From SVN to GIT
===============

Notes from tutorial : 

Getting the SVN repository simply with history of commits only
===============================================================
git svn clone svn://zone.spip.org/spip-zone/_plugins_/crayons
Please note you can import only a directory not the full svn repository

cd crayons
git log
You can see all the history of commits here.


Getting the SVN repository simply with history of commits and authors
======================================================================
You would need to get the authors list in a file from  the svn logs. You need to do this prior to make the import.

Here is an helpfull script for doing so
authors=$(svn log -q svn://zone.spip.org/spip-zone/_plugins_/crayons | grep -e '^r' | awk 'BEGIN { FS = "|" } ; { print $2 }' | sort | uniq)
for author in ${authors}; do
  echo "${author} = ${author%@*} <${author}>";
done

Copy and paste the output into a file (let's call it SVNAuthors)
Take time to review the authors to ensure they have github acconts

Now let's import the svn with authors
git svn --authors-file=SVNAuthors clone svn://zone.spip.org/spip-zone/_plugins_/crayons

Let's check the result
git log -n2

(Optional) Cleaning the commits
===============================
This method kept the svn ID, you may want to get rid of those references (if your SVN is private)
This command will clean those references

git filter-branch --msg-filter 'sed -e "/git-svn-id:/d"'
